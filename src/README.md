# WoW Battle Royale

This project aims to transform the open-source TrinityCore World of Warcraft server into a Battle Royale game mode.

Project overview:
- Random player spawns across a custom map (13k+ hand-placed models).
- Loot spawning in designated areas.
- Shrinking safe zone to force encounters.
- Last-man-standing win condition.

Technical goals:
- Modify TrinityCore C++ core for match systems.
- Use SQL scripts for spawns, loot tables, events.
- Integrate the custom map into client/server.
- Build match logic for elimination and victory detection.

Challenges:
- Heavy C++ core work required.
- Performance and balancing on large maps.
- Legal/asset constraints if the project goes public.
