![Project Logo](logo.png)  

A **Battle Royale game server** built on the open-source World of Warcraft emulator **TrinityCore**. This project transforms the traditional MMORPG gameplay into match-based survival battles on a custom map.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

Transform **TrinityCore** into a **Battle Royale server** with:  
- Match-based gameplay (queue â†’ match â†’ end â†’ reset)  
- Randomized player spawning  
- Loot-based progression (weapons, ammo, items)  
- Shrinking safe zone mechanic  
- Last-player/team standing win condition  
- Optimized server for multiple concurrent players  

---

## âš¡ Core Features

- **Matchmaking System:** Players join a queue, enter a match, and the match resets after completion.  
- **Player Spawning:** Random spawn points or air-drop system across the custom map.  
- **Safe Zone:** Dynamic shrinking area; players outside take damage.  
- **Loot System:** Weapons, ammo, and consumables are scattered around the map.  
- **Win Condition:** Last player or team standing ends the match.
